# TodoApp - Extended Challenge

## üìã General Requirements

- As a client, I want an application that manages a list of pending tasks.
- As a client, I want an application created with Vite and developed with React/JavaScript.

## üß© Components

- As a client, I want a `<Header/>` component that renders a level #1 heading with the text '_TodoApp_'.
- As a client, I want a `<Subheader>` component that renders a level #2 heading with the text '_Todo List Manager_'. This component should receive a `subtitle` prop to make it reusable in other parts of the application.
- As a client, I want a `<ListHeader>` component that renders a level #3 heading with the text '_Todo List_'. This component should receive a `content` prop to make it reusable in other parts of the application.
- As a client, I want an `<ItemCard>` component that renders an item of an unordered list with all the required information. This component should receive an `item` prop to make it reusable in other parts of the application.
  - Item title should be rendered using a level #4 heading.
    - It must be strikethrough if the status item is '_done_'.
    - It must be bold if the status item is '_in progress_'.
    - It must be regular if the status item is '_pending_'.
  - Item description should be rendered using a paragraph.
  - Item status should be rendered using a span.
    - It must be in green if the status item is '_done_'.
    - It must be in blue if the status item is '_in progress_'.
    - It must be in grey if the status item is '_pending_'.
- As a client, I want an `<ItemsList>` component that renders an unordered list with an `<ItemCard>` for each item in the list. This component should receive an `itemsList` prop to make it reusable in other parts of the application.
- As a client, I want a `<ListContainer/>` component that renders only the elements it wraps [`<ListHeader>` and `<ItemsList>`].

## ‚ú® New Features

- **Task Creation Form:**

  - As a client, I want a `<TaskForm>` component that allows users to create new tasks.
  - The form should include fields for:
    - Task title (required).
    - Task description (required).
    - Task status (default to '_pending_').
  - The form should include a submit button to add the task to the list.

- **State Persistence:**

  - As a client, I want the application to persist pending tasks in its state.
  - The newly added tasks should be displayed in the `<ItemsList>` component.
  - The application should maintain the list state even after re-renders.

- **Component Testing:**

  - As a client, I want basic unit tests for the following components:
    - `<ItemsList>`: To ensure it correctly renders the list of tasks.
    - `<ItemCard>`: To validate that items are displayed with the correct formatting according to their status.

- **CI Configuration:**
  - As a client, I want `LintStaged` and `Husky` to be configured in the project to validate the CI process.
  - Linting and formatting should be automatically checked before committing changes.
  - Pre-commit hooks should run tests to ensure code stability.

## üé® Styles

- As a client, I want the application to adhere to the design of the provided prototype.
- As a client, I want each component to be responsible only for its styles to avoid collisions.
- As a client, I want class names to adhere to BEM notation.
- As a client, I want the design to be 'mobile first'.

## üåê Browser

- As a client, I want the browser tab to display '_TodoApp_'.
- As a client, I want the console to show no errors.

## üöÄ DevOps and Deployment

- As a client, I want the application to be deployed and available through a URL in the preview environment before going to production.

This challenge extends the previous version by adding task creation, state management, component testing, and CI validation with LintStaged and Husky. Good luck!
